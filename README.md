It is meant to be simple, no bullshit, and having merit as a first class priority. It addresses common problem with other common Code of Conducts that favors favoritism, even outside the scope of the project, instead of the actual contribution to the project, something that actually allow it to move forward.

You're free to adapt this Code of Conduct to your project. To do so, simply copy CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to your project's root directory.
